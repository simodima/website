## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simone, a Staff Software Developer with a relentless passion for software design, architecture, and scalability. My journey into the world of code began back in school, and I've never looked back since. It's been an incredible ride through the landscapes of tech, where every line of code brings a new opportunity to learn and grow.

Beyond the keyboard sound, I'm also a dad to two amazing boys who keep life exciting and full of joy.

When I'm not crafting software or spending time with my family, you'll likely find me outdoors. I'm a big fan of running, cycling, and just about any activity that lets me enjoy nature's beauty. There's something rejuvenating about feeling the wind in your face and the thrill of exploration on a good run or ride.

I love coding in Golangâ€”it's become one of my favorite languages for its clarity and efficiency. But don't get me wrong; Iâ€™m not tied to any single language. For me, it's not about starting wars over programming languages; it's about finding the right tool to solve the problem at hand.

Let's connect and share some awesome ideas!

Simone ðŸ––
